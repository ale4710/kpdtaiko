ABOUT IMAGES:
the image you set will be scaled to fit the height of the top space. it will fill the ENTIRE space, and go under the UI.
the height is 64px, and the width is limited to the width of the screen.

the spritesheet layout is horizontal. the program will automatically split the image evenly. the config file will determine how many frames there are.
