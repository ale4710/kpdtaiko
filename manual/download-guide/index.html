		<h2 id="find-download">find+download</h2>
		<p>the first step is to, of course, find some songs that you like!
		<p>just download them to your device for now. the next step will tell you what to do with them.
		<p>below are some websites that you can use to download some songs. the list is grouped by filetype.
		<h3>osu</h3>
		<b>note: ensure that the chartset you download is the correct gamemode. it is either labeled "Taiko" or with the following icon:</b> <img src="taiko.png" />
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/" target="_blank">osu!</a> (official, user account required)</li>
			<li><a href="https://beatconnect.io/" target="_blank">BeatConnect</a> (mirror)</li>
			<li><a href="https://nerinyan.moe/main?m=1" target="_blank">Nerinyan</a> (mirror)</li>
			<li>
				<a href="https://chimu.moe/beatmaps" target="_blank">chimu.moe</a> (mirror)
				<br><i>note: there is no gamemode filtering, and every download will open a new browser window.</i>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>tja</h3>
		<b>note: although some websites are provided here, tja files are really scattered throughout the internet, as opposed to osu with one database with some mirrors. you will need more effort and researching skills with tja files. if you don't think you have the resources or skills, i recommend skipping tja files for now.</b>
		<ul>
			<li>
				TJADB: <a href="https://tjadataba.se/" target="_blank">here</a> OR <a href="https://dev.pidgey.net/browse" target="_blank">here</a>
				<br><i>you may also join their discord: https://discord.gg/tjadb</i>
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="https://taikosanjiro-humenroom.net/" target="_blank">太鼓さん次郎 譜面配布の部屋</a>
				<br><i>note: this website is only in Japanese. also, only difficult charts are available here.</i>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>reminder, tja files are scattered throughout the internet. use your favorite search engine if you intend to find tja charts.
		<p>once you're done downloading songs, proceed to the next step.

		<h2 id="move">move</h2>
		<p>once you've downloaded some charts, you must then move them into the import folder.
		<p>first: with your file manager, <b>select</b> the files that you've downloaded.
		<p><img src="select.png" />
		<p>next: <b>move</b> the files...
		<p><img src="move.png" />
		<p>...into the import folder.
		<p>it is located at <b>/others/.kpdtaiko/import/</b>
		<p><img src="goto-import.png" />
		<p>you have moved the files.
		<p><img src="done-move.png" />
		<p>proceed to the next step.
		<p><a href="#top">top</a>
		
		
		
		<h2 id="import-scan">import+scan</h2>
		<p>at this point, it is very simple.
		<p>open the game, and select <b>Import</b> on the title screen.
		<p>Follow the on screen instructions.
		<p>Once it finishes, it will show you a summary of what was imported.
		<p><img src="import-summary.png" />
		<p>If it all looks good, hit "continue", then hit "back". It will then ask you if you want to rescan the song library. <b>select yes.</b>
		<p>Once that's done, ensure that the songs were imported correctly.
		<p>once you know the songs were imported correctly, then you can clear the import folder. <i>(the import folder keeps the archives you downloaded in case something goes wrong)</i>
		<p>then, you're done!! enjoy playing!!!
