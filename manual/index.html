		<h2 id="setup">setup</h2>
		<p>in order to play this game, you need charts.
		<h3>about charts</h3>
		<p>there are two supported formats: tja and osu.
		<p>osu charts are the easiest to get, as you simply download them from the official website or a mirror.
		<p>tja charts are scattered throughout the internet. you'll have to seek them out yourself.
		<p><b>important</b>: for tja charts, diverge notes are NOT supported.
		<h3>where to put charts</h3>
		<p>put the charts in <code>.domtaiko/songs/</code>.
		<p>if you have a file in <code>zip</code> or <code>osk</code> format, that means that you have a song archive, and it should be put in <code>.domtaiko/import/</code> instead. please see the <a href="#song-import">song import tool</a> for more details.
		<p><a href="#top">top</a>
		
		
		
		<h2 id="song-import">song import tool</h2>
		<p>the song import tool is a tools that can automatically extract song archives and import them into the song library.
		<h3>how to use</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>place song archives in the <code>import</code> folder of the game folder. it can extract <code>zip</code> archives only. (note: <code>osz</code> files are also zips)</li>
			<li>open the game, and select the "Import" option on the title screen.</li>
			<li>follow the on screen instructions (it should be pretty obvious from here on out)</li>
			<li>you are done</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>important notes</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>i wrote this really quickly, so it probably will break pretty easily.</li>
			<li>this will only extract the required files needed for gameplay.</li>
			<li>the archives won't be removed after they are imported. please delete them yourself once you confirm that they're imported correctly.</li>

		<h3>keybinds</h3>
		<p><code>1</code> = toggle autoplay
		<p><code>3</code> = select random song

		<h2 id="hit-windows">hit windows</h2>
		<p>there are settings that allow you to modify the hit windows.
		<h3>hit window sizes</h3>
		<p>the following is a table that lists the allowed deviation from the target time.
		<p>so 10ms would mean that the window is 20ms wide. 10ms too early and 10ms too late.
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>size</th>
				<th>good</th>
				<th>okay</th>
				<th>miss</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>normal</td>
				<td>35ms</td>
				<td>80ms</td>
				<td>95ms</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>wide</td>
				<td>46ms</td>
				<td>104ms</td>
				<td>124ms</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>tight</td>
				<td>24ms</td>
				<td>56ms</td>
				<td>67ms</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<h3>hit window modification</h3>
		<p>you are allowed to create your own hit windows.
		<p>the settings are located at <code>settings > game settings > hit windows</code>.
		<p>the number you put in will be the allowed deviation from the target time.
		<h3>about miss hit window</h3>
		<p>the miss hit window is a kind of "spam" protection.
		<p>if you were to spam "don" in a chart full of dons, it is likely that you will land within the miss hit window.
		<p>if you play normally, however, it's unlikely (but still possible) that you'll hit the miss hit window.

		<h2 id="offset-adjustment">offset adjustment</h2>
		<h3>how offset works</h3>
		<p>basically, positive values will make the notes appear later, and negative values will make the notes appear later.
		<h3>global offset</h3>
		<p>global offset can be adjusted from the settings menu.
		<h3>local offset</h3>
		<p>during gameplay, you can press and hold <code>#</code> on your keypad to get the following to appear in the corner:
		<center>
			<img src="offset-info.png" />
		</center>
		<p>this will display the local offset for the chart, the global offset for the entire game, and the current average hit error for the entire current attempt.
		<p>while holding <code>#</code>, you can also press the directional keys to adjust the local offset, or press <code>1</code> on your keypad to reset the local offset back to zero.
		<center>
			<img src="offset-adjust-keybinds.png" />
		</center>
		<h3>about screenshots</h3>
		<p>on most devices you can press <code>*</code> and <code>#</code> to take a screenshot. this means that you can take a screenshot of the results screen. however, this obviously overlaps with the keybind for the offset display.
		<p>if you don't want the offset display to show up while taking a screenshot, you can press <code>*</code> first before pressing <code>#</code>. Pressing <code>*</code> first will prevent the offset display from showing up.
